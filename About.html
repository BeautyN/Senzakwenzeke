              Senzakwenzeke Child and Youth Care Organisation was established on 01 February 2015, by a group
              of young people in the community of Vosloorus, having identified the need in the community to protect children from adverse social effects prevalent in
              the community.</p>

            and caregivers assists with school homework, assignments, and extra
            mural activities and psycho-social support. We offer support to unemployed youths by bringing solutions to help overcome  unemployment challenges, with a special focus on crime and drug
